## Autoencoder
Playing around with a convolutional autoencoder on CIFAR images. Use a series of residual blocks in an hourglass architecture that compresses the variation of the images down to a space 8% of the original size. 

I performed this experiment on CPU, so did some goofy things with training to get a feeling for how the training results would look.
